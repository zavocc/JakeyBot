The best way to get started is through Docker method... You can directly pull the image from my Docker üê≥ Hub repository and simply run the bot below:
```
~ $ docker pull zavocc/jakey:sugilite
~ $ docker run -it --env-file dev.env --rm jakey:sugilite
```

NOTE: You need to provide [the dev.env file](#configuring) as explained below

<details>
  <summary>Manual installation</summary>
  But if you prefer manual method without using containers, you need to install Python version atleast 3.10+ with pip and venv is highly preferred and run the commands

  You must create a virtual environment before proceeding which you can do by running:
  ```
  python -m venv .venv

  # Activate
  . .venv/bin/activate
  ```

  Install dependencies as needed
  ```
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt

  # This is optional
  pip3 install wavelink
  pip3 uninstall py-cord discord.py
  pip3 install py-cord
  ```
</details>

## Configuring
After you install the required dependencies, configure your bot first by heading over to [dev.env.template](./dev.env.template) and save it as `dev.env` in the gitroot directory

You will need to provide Discord bot token from the developers portal.

Please see [CONFIG.md](./docs/CONFIG.md) for more information about configuration.

### Music features
You can enable VC-related commands such as `/voice play` (which plays videos from YouTube and other supported sources) by providing appropriate Lavalink sources

Please see [CONFIG.md#voice](./docs/CONFIG.md#voice) to configure wavelink

You can use the list of 3rd party servers from and use servers from https://lavalink.darrennathanael.com/NoSSL/lavalink-without-ssl/ and configure the `dev.env` file pointing the third party Lavalink servers, no installation required... 

Alternatively, you can also host your own... Refer to [lavalink documentation](https://lavalink.dev/getting-started/index.html) to configure your own lavalink setup... make sure to install OpenJDK before you proceed.
