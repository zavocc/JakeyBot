## Installation
The only thing you'd need is Python with PIP and venv!

### Required permissions for Discord bot
- Read message history (see [#faq](#faq) for privacy implications)
- Embed messages (required for rendering text more than 4096 and for most commands)
- Send messages (obviously)
- Attach files
- Create webhooks
- Create slash commands
- Voice related features such as connect, disconnect

### Required dependencies
- Python 3.10+ with pip \
    If you use Linux distros, I strongly require you to install Python with venv support due to [PEP 0668](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/) and [PEP 0453](https://peps.python.org/pep-0453/) for rationale.

There may be other dependencies needed for some operations such as tools. Please see [TOOLS.md](./docs/TOOLS.md) for rationale.

### Installation
Once you activated your enviornment and has pip ready, you can run
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Wavelink isn't installed by default, you must perform these tasks to enable music VC features
```
pip3 install wavelink
pip3 uninstall py-cord discord.py
pip3 install py-cord
```

## Configuring
After you install the required dependencies, configure your bot first by heading over to [dev.env.template](./dev.env.template) and save it as `dev.env` in the gitroot directory

You will need to provide Discord bot token from the developers portal.

Please see [CONFIG.md](./docs/CONFIG.md) for more information about configuration.

### Wavelink configuration:
You can enable VC-related commands such as `/voice play` (which plays videos from YouTube and other supported sources)

Please see [CONFIG.md#voice](./docs/CONFIG.md#voice) to configure wavelink

#### Serverless lavalink
You can use the list of 3rd party servers from and use servers from https://lavalink.darrennathanael.com/NoSSL/lavalink-without-ssl/ and configure the `dev.env` file pointing the third party Lavalink servers, no installation required... 

---

#### Your own lavalink server
You can also host your own lavalink server, you must install OpenJDK and download the [Lavalink jar file](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/releases) and placing it as `_wavelink/Lavalink.jar` in project's root directory.

Activate voice by placing `Lavalink.jar` and copy `application.yml.template` to `application.yml` and run `java -jar Lavalink.jar` in separate session before starting the bot.

If you decide to configure the port, address, and password, make sure it reflects to the `dev.env` file as well.


## Running the server
After everything is configured, you can run `main.py`

Get started by asking Jakey `/ask prompt:Who are you and how can I get started`
