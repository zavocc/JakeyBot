When editing an image, it's recommended to keep the prompt simple to prevent unnecessary elements being added or deviations as it is a LLM model that is contextually capable at editing images, you do not need to describe the original image as prompt again if the attachment was provided, just prompt the requested changes without adding extra to little info of the image. For example, when a cat image is provided and user asks to edit it to have a hat, just say add a hat."
