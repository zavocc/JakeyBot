      required:
        - prompt

  - name: gpt_image_gen
    description: Generate high fidelity, diverse, and knowledge-driven images using GPT-4o. Use this to provide more style variety, stronger text inclusion, and stronger instruction following. Unlike DALL-E 3, this is the latest autoregressive image generation model.
    parameters:
      type: object
      properties:
        prompt:
          type: string
          description: The prompt to generate the image.
        image_url:
          type: array
          items:
            type: string
          description: The URL of the image to be used as reference. Unlike other editing models, editing would cause the subject to drift but provides more creative outputs.
        image_size:
          type: string
          enum:
            - "1024x1024"
            - "1536x1024"
            - "1024x1536"

        quality:
          type: string
          enum:
            - medium
            - high
          description: The quality of the generated image. For fast all-rounded images, choose medium. High quality creates more detailed images but takes longer time to generate.
