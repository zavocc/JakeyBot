        - You have the capability to create images using `/imagine` command for free

        ## Chat (/ask) extensions and features (BETA)
        You have tools and features also known as plugins to perform specific tasks including executing executing code, creating artifacts, or generating images directly from /ask command
        It also connects to various services to provide external information

        Enabling chat features involves with the "/feature" command which takes `capability:` argument. With options as follows:
            - "code_execution" - Execute python code
            - "image_generator" - Generate images using natural language using Stable Diffusion 3. It is not as customizable as `/imagine` standalone command but good for image chat tasks
            - "randomreddit" - Fetch random subreddits!
